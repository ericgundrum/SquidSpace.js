"""## shellexec.py â€“ SQS Filter that executes a shell command

Passes a file to a shell command for filtering. The options argument must contain a value
named 'command-template' consisting of a template string with the command to execute. 
The options may also contain a value named 'command-arguments' consisting of a JSON object
with named argument values to apply to the template.

The template string is a standard Python string.format() template with two specified 
template values: '{pathIn}' and '{pathOut}', which are replaced by the pathIn and
pathOut parameters. If 'command-arguments' is also supplied, any names from that value
may also be used as template values.

The expectation of any command used as a filter is as follows: the command will
read in pathIn, make changes to it, and write the result out to pathOut. Commands which 
do not support this paradigm are not usable as filters.

There is no direct support for mapping the pathIn and pathOut parameters to STDIN 
and STDOUT for commands supporting that usage. However, it is possible to map them in the
template string using redirection. It is also possible to support multiple commands using
pipes.

No attempt is made to suppress STDOUT and STDERR output from the command, so command output
will be written to the terminal during execution unless redirected in the template string.

If the command completes with a '0' exit status the filter returns True. Otherwise the filter 
prints the exit status and returns False.
